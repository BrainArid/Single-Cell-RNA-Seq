    abstract = {<title>Author Summary</title><p>Proteins interact with each other in a network manner to precisely regulate complicated physiological functions of life. Diseases such as cancer may occur if the network regulations go wrong. In cancer research, network mining has been utilized to identify biomarkers, predict therapeutic targets, and discover new mechanisms for cancer development. Among these applications, the search for genes with similar expression patterns (co-expression) over different samples is particularly successful. However, few network mining approaches were systematically applied to different types of cancers to extract common cancer features. We carried out a systematic study to identify frequently co-expressed gene networks in multiple cancers and compared them with the gene networks found in multiple normal tissues. We found dramatic differences between networks from the two sources, with gene networks in cancer corresponding to specific traits of cancer. Specifically, the largest gene network in cancer contains many genes with cell cycle control and DNA stability functions. We thus predicted that a set of poorly studied genes in this network share similar functions and validated that most of these genes are involved in DNA break repair or proper cell division. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest scale of such a study.</p>},
